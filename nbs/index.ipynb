    "`scilint` aims to **bring a style and quality standard into notebook based Data Science workflows**. How you define a quality notebook is difficult and somewhat subjective. It can have the obvious meaning of being free of bugs but also legibility and ease of comprehension are important too.\n",
    "\n",
    "`scilint` takes the approach of breaking down potentially quality relevant aspects of the notebook and providing what we believe are sensible defaults that potentially correlate with higher quality workflows. We also let users define the quality line as they see fit through configuration of existing thresholds and ability to add new metrics. As use of the library grows we anticipate being able to statistically relate some of the quality relevant attributes to key delivery metrics like \"change failure rate\" or \"lead time to production\"."
