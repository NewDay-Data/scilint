It can have the obvious meaning of being free of bugs but also legibility and ease of comprehension are important too.\n",

We also let users define the quality line as they see fit through configuration of existing thresholds and ability to add new metrics. As use of the library grows we anticipate being able to statistically relate some of the quality relevant attributes to key delivery metrics like \"change failure rate\" or \"lead time to production\"."

    "\n",
    "*If you prefer to move out of notebook-based workflows, post-exploration to an IDE+Python mix I encourage you to have another ponder on the benefits of staying in a notebook-based workflow. Notebooks have a strong visual emphasis and proximity to data. They are also the primary axis of change within Data Science - new ideas are gained from diving into data. So instead of packing up your code, re-writing it for elsewhere and all the waste that entails bring quality to your exploration workflow and spend more time building stuff that matters.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're still not convinced watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk) where **Jeremy Howard** does a far better job of explaining why notebooks are for serious development too!\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ What is Notebook Quality?\n",
    "This is a good question and this library does not pretend to have the answer. But we feel the problem space is worth exploring because the value of high quality deliveries means lower time-to-market, less time in re-work or rote porting of code and frees people up to think about and solve hard problems.\n",
    "That said, there are some practices that we have observed producing \"better\" notebooks workflows from experience in production Data Science teams. These are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Extracting code to functions\n",
    "* Testing logic as well as data behaviour\n",
    "* Putting sufficient emphasis on legibility and ease of comprehension through adequate use of markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the starting premises that permit the notebook quality conversation to start. To bring this to life a little, we would say that **the notebook on left is of lower quality than the notebook on the right**.."
