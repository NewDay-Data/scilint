# Standing on the shoulders of giants - *an nbdev library*

> `scilint` is written on top of the excellent `nbdev` library. This
> library is revolutionary as it truly optimises all the benefits of
> notebooks and compensates for some of their weaker points. For more
> information on `nbdev` see the [homepage](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) or
> [github repo](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev)

# Getting Started

`pip install scilint`

`scilint` has the following main features/commands:

-   [`scilint_tidy`](https://newday-data.github.io/scilint/scilint.html#scilint_tidy):
    run an in-place opinionated flavour of
    [nbQA](https://github.com/nbQA-dev/nbQA) to tidy up your ntoebooks
-   [`scilint_lint`](https://newday-data.github.io/scilint/scilint.html#scilint_lint):
    inspect the notebooks for potential quality correlates and report on
    the findings
-   [`scilint_build`](https://newday-data.github.io/scilint/scilint.html#scilint_build):
    the build command for notebooks: ensuring they all run, pass their
    tests and meet a consistent style/quality standard

# Contributing

After you clone this repository, please run nbdev_install_hooks in your
terminal. This sets up git hooks, which clean up the notebooks to remove
the extraneous stuff stored in the notebooks (e.g.¬†which cells you ran)
which causes unnecessary merge conflicts.

To run the tests in parallel, launch nbdev_test.

Before submitting a PR, check that the local library and notebooks
match.

If you made a change to the notebooks in one of the exported cells, you
can export it to the library with nbdev_prepare. If you made a change to
the library, you can export it back to the notebooks with nbdev_update.
